In 2004, I provided interior design documents for the remodel of a historic craftsman home in Pasadena CA.  Formerly used as an architectâ€™s office, the building was purchased by [vision.org](https://www.vision.org/ "Vision - Sharing Insights and Exploring New Horizons") and serves as the headquarters for this publishing and video production non-profit foundation.

Project Role: Interior Design.

A number of dryrot and insect damage issues were also addressed as a part of the remodel at rafter tails and exterior wood railings.  A custom glass reception desk was among the interior design items provided.
