It has long fascinated me how many diverse career paths are available to the trained architect, yet so few grasp or create the opportunity to broaden our design scope and bring better products and services to a client. The opportunity to learn and grow is one I constantly seek.

As an Assistant Vice President in Marx\|Okubo’s Pasadena office, I help manage the region's activities, staffing and projects, performing architectural consulting, sustainability reviews, property condition assessments, owner’s representation-related services and accessibility reviews across California. 

I conduct CASp and other detailed accessibility reviews of office, shopping center, and multifamily properties, and completed certificate programs on accessibility and universal design at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design in 2014 and 2018.

Since 1995, I have been involved in diverse construction and architectural projects, including retail, office and interiors, as well as community college and K-12 educational facilities. 

Prior to joining Marx\|Okubo, I served as a project architect for a Los Angeles-based architectural firm, and worked on construction document preparation, project management, specifications writing, governmental plan processing, and construction administration.
